# Access Code

The access code is a unique string that is used for one-time authentication. This is particularly used for delegates who need to view conference papers. 

The access code is designed to be used once, providing an additional layer of security. After a delegate uses this code, it becomes invalid and cannot be used again. This prevents unauthorized users from gaining access to the conference papers if they somehow obtain a previously used code.

Here's an example of what an access code might look like:

```markdown
STATIC_ACCESS_CODE=DGCA592024PH
```

In this example, `DGCA592024PH` is the access code. This would be provided to a delegate who needs to view the conference papers. Once the delegate uses this code, it becomes invalid and a new code would need to be generated for the next delegate.
