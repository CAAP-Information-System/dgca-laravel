                        Discussion Papers (DP) deal with substantive matters that are intended to be raised at the Conference under the Agenda Items listed in the Provisional Agenda, provided in the Conference website. Since the Provisional Agenda may be changed, all papers received will be accommodated under appropriate items of the final Agenda.

                    <li>
                        It is emphasized that the Discussion Papers for the Conference should focus more on matters at policy level, conceptual issues, as well as global and regional trends, for a more productive outcome. It should be noted that <b class="text-primary">ICAO APAC Contributory Bodies</b> such as the RASG-APAC, APANPIRG, RASCF and their affiliated bodies provide the most appropriate forum to deliberate on matters of specific technical nature in view of the presence of relevant subject matter experts in those fora, therefore it is strongly recommended that submission of Discussion Papers with such contents to the DGCA Conference be avoided to the extent possible.

                    <li>
                        States/Administrations and Organizations are also requested to avoid submitting Discussion Papers which have already been presented in previous DGCA Conferences as well as other regional meetings with similar content.

                States/Administrations and International Organizations are urged to submit their papers at the earliest possible convenience, but not later than <b>(day) (Month) 2024</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The papers should be sent as <b class="text-primary">e-mail attachment</b> to the ICAO Asia and Pacific Regional Office and copied to the Host State on the following addresses:
            </p>
            <ul class="conf-addresses">

            </ul>
            <p>
                Timely distribution of the papers is particularly important in the case of Discussion Papers so that the matters raised can be given due consideration by the delegates. All papers received by the specified deadline will be posted in pdf format on the website established by the Host State for the purpose of this Conference. Every effort is made by the Host Organizing Committee and the Secretariat to make papers available to participating delegates prior to the Conference.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the question of selection of papers, the Directors General of Civil Aviation, during the 42nd Conference also decided that it should be left to the ICAO Regional Office. The Regional Office would select papers for presentation bearing in mind the time allocated to each session. Only Discussion Papers would be taken up for presentation while the Information Papers, which often provide valuable materials, should continue to be encouraged, but only for the information of delegations.
